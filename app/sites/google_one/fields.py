"""Typing and clicking against Google's JS-driven forms.

Both the login and the signup flow drive the same Material inputs, and both hit
the same failure: the field node is replaced when Google re-renders it, so
keystrokes sent across that swap land on a detached element. The value never
arrives, `aria-invalid` stays set, the Next control stays disabled, and the
click on it is silently swallowed — the run then spins on the same screen until
it runs out of steps and reports a false "stuck".

`fill` and `click` here verify the effect rather than the request: read the
value back, wait for the control to become enabled, and retry on a fresh node
handle when either did not hold.
